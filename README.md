## Purpose

This project represents my approach to building structured web systems:

- Clean semantic HTML
- Modular CSS architecture
- Minimal, intentional JavaScript
- Performance-first mindset
- Long-term maintainability over short-term speed

The site acts as both a personal profile and a demonstration of calm, sustainable web development.

## Architecture Approach

The website intentionally avoids frameworks to demonstrate strong foundational principles.

- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Clear folder structure
- Separated language versions (EN / CZ)
- Accessible navigation patterns
- Lightweight JavaScript for interaction only
- Deployment via GitHub Pages

This reflects how I approach larger systems:
clear structure, controlled complexity, and deliberate technical decisions.
